                    <h2>First Designs</h2>
                        <h3>First programmable computer</h3>
                            <p>The very first programmable computer was made somewhere between 1936 and 1938, first made by a german man named Konrad Zuse.</p>
                            <P>Konrad named it Z1 and it was made in his parents living room. </p>

                        <h3>The First Electronic Computer</h3>
                            <P>The ABC was an electrical computer that used more than 300 vacuum tubes for digital computation.</p> 
                            <P>including binary math and Boolean logic,Even though it did all that math it had no CPU</P>

                    <h2>The Familiar Computer</h2>
                        <h3>The IBM</h3>
                            <p>The 60's was the year they started to make the computers we know today</p>
                            <p>the design was getting closer with the IBM</p>
                            <p>the IBM or mini computer was in progress relesed in 1969</p>
                            <p>1964 – The first working liquid crystal display (LCD) was built by George H. Heilmeier. The original LCD displays were based on what is called dynamic scattering mode (DSM). 1964 – The first flat plasma display panel (PDP) was invented by Donald Bitzer, Gene Slottow and Robert Willson</p>
                            <p>The first computer mouse was publicly unveiled in 1968 by its inventor, Douglas C. Engelbart. He invented the computer mouse in 1964 — two decades before it would ship with the first Apple Macintosh</p>
                            <p>ARPANET adopted TCP/IP on January 1, 1983, and from there researchers began to assemble the “network of networks” that became the modern Internet. The online world then took on a more recognizable form in 1990, when computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web.</p>

                        <h2>The Modern Computer</h2>
                            <h3>Common Computer</h3>
                                <p>The first personal computers, introduced in 1975, came as kits: The MITS Altair 8800, followed by the IMSAI 8080, an Altair clone. (Yes, cloning has been around that long!) Both used the Intel 8080 CPU.</p>
                                <P>At this point in time computers were being made smaller and smaller as the years went by, the components got smaller and so the machine it self got smaller. Eventually leading to LCD screens, a small tower, key board, and mouse. Some were even smaller such as the laptop or smart phone. </p>
                                <P>In the late 1950's, computers got smaller because one of its main components – the valve – was replaced by the much smaller transistor. ... A microchip could have several transistors on it. But being smaller, it lead again to a decrease in the size of computers. By 1965, there were 20,000 computers in the world. Ever since then they kept getting smaller.</P>
